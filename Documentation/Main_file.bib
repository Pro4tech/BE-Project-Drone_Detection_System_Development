A study on decoding the DSM2 protocol of communication is presented. In order to understand the protocol, raw RF data were collected using Software Defined Radio and LabView software. A set of tools were written in MAT LAB to analyze the data, extract the bursts, perform synchronization and demodulate the chips. Understanding the communication is vital when creating a counter drone system. The possibility of smart jamming the DSM2 protocol of communication is analyzed in the final part of the paper.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/ICComm.2018.8484821},  ISSN={},  month={June},}
